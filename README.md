Create textures from Glsl fragment shaders on Blender 2.8+

# Install

// TODO

# Use

1. Operator Search: `F3` (or `SpaceBar` depending on your setup)
2. Type GlslTexture
3. Change `width` and `height` size and `Source` file (which can be a path to an external file). 
4. Use the Image on your materials. The Image name will be based on the name of the source file.
5. Go to the Text Editor (or an external editor if your source file is external) and edit the shader. It will hot reload.
